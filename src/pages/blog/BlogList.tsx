    shortdesc: `When we think of a heart attack, we often picture someone clutching
            their chest in pain. But in reality, heart attack symptoms can be
            far more subtle—and they vary significantly between men and women.
            Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, but with
            early detection and immediate action, many lives can be saved.
            Whether you're reading this for yourself, a loved one, or a patient,
            understanding the warning signs of a heart attack is crucial.`,
    longdesc: `A heart attack doesn’t always start with a dramatic collapse or sharp chest pain—in fact, many begin with subtle symptoms that are easy to dismiss. Recognizing these warning signs early can make the difference between life and death. Common indicators include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, pain in the arms or jaw, cold sweats, and extreme fatigue. These symptoms may vary between men and women, with women more likely to experience back pain, indigestion, or overwhelming tiredness. If you or someone near you is experiencing multiple symptoms—especially if they come on suddenly—don’t wait. Call emergency services immediately. Fast action saves lives.`,
